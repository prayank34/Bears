    <p>
        <strong>Bears</strong> are large mammals belonging to the family Ursidae, and they are found across various
        habitats in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Here are some key points about bears.
    </p>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Diversity:</strong> There are eight species of bears in the world, each with its own unique
            characteristics and habitat. These species include the American black bear, brown bear (which includes
            grizzly bears and Kodiak bears), polar bear, Asiatic black bear, sloth bear, sun bear, spectacled bear, and
            giant panda.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Physical Characteristics:</strong> Bears typically have stocky bodies, large paws with sharp claws,
            and a short tail. They have a keen sense of smell and are known for their powerful jaws. The size of bears
            varies greatly among species, with the polar bear being the largest and the sun bear being the smallest.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Diet:</strong> Bears are omnivores, meaning they eat both plants and animals. Their diet varies
            depending on the species and the availability of food in their habitat. Some bears primarily feed on
            vegetation such as berries, nuts, and roots, while others hunt for fish, small mammals, and even.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Habitat:</strong> Bears inhabit a wide range of ecosystems, including forests, mountains, tundra,
            and polar regions. They have adapted to diverse environments and can thrive in both temperate and cold
            climates.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>Overall, bears play a vital role in their ecosystems as top predators and seed dispersers, and they are iconic
        symbols of wilderness and conservation efforts around the world.</p>
